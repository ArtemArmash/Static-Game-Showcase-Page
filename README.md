# Static Game Showcase Page

This project is a simple, visually appealing static webpage built with HTML and CSS. It showcases three popular video games—CS 2, Dota 2, and Team Fortress 2—using a modern, card-based layout. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a clean implementation of a responsive flexbox layout.

## About The Project

This is a beginner-friendly project that serves as an excellent practical example for those learning front-end web development. It illustrates how to structure content with semantic HTML and how to style it effectively with CSS. The layout is fully responsive and centered, making it look good on various screen sizes.

### Concepts and Features Demonstrated

*   **HTML5 for Structure**: The content is logically structured using a main `div` container with three child elements for each game.
*   **CSS3 for Styling**:
    *   **Flexbox Layout**: The core of the layout is `display: flex`, used to easily align and distribute the game cards on the page.
    *   **Custom Styling**: The project features custom styles for borders, padding, shadows (`box-shadow`), and rounded corners (`border-radius`) to create a modern "card" UI.
    *   **Button Styling**: The "CLICK" links are styled to look like interactive, three-dimensional buttons.
    *   **CSS Reset**: A universal selector (`*`) is used for a basic reset of margin and padding, ensuring consistent styling across browsers.
*   **External Linking**: Each game card includes a button that links to the official website for that game.
*   **Image Handling**: Images are styled with a consistent width and border.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files and a folder for images:

*   **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the webpage. It contains the text, image references, and links for each game showcase card.
*   **`style.css`**: The external stylesheet that contains all the CSS rules for styling the page, including the flexbox layout, card design, and button appearance.
*   **`/images/` (Folder)**: This folder should contain the image files used in the project (`cs2.jpg`, `dota-2-classic-image-2937.jpg`, `capsule_616x353.jpg`).

3.  **Add the Images**:
    *   Inside the project folder, create a new folder named `images`.
    *   Place the three game images inside this `images` folder. Make sure their filenames match those in the `index.html` file.
